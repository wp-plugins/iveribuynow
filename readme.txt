iVeri Buy Now button makes it easy to insert a "Buy Now" button which interfaces with the iVeri Lite payment gateway (http://www.iveri.co.za)

== Description ==

The iVeri Buy Now Button plugin makes use of shortcodes to simplify insertion of a "buy now" button. Using the shortcode system means you can insert as many Buy Now buttons you need into any post or page you desire.

When a customer clicks on an inserted "buy now button" they're presented with an unobtrusive pop-up form to enter their contact and credit card details (all of which are forwarded to the iVeri Secure Payment Gateway for processing). On completion of the transaction, the customer is redirected back to your website with a customizable response message.

Transactions are recorded for easy viewing in your Wordpress admin panel. 

Please note: Most compatible with PHP5

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Set the options in the Settings Panel
4. Follow the instructions on the Settings Panel and insert a relevant shortcode into the desired location
